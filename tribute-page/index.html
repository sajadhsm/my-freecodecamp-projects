      <b>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie</b> is best known for his work on computer languages and operating systems ALTRAN, B, BCPL,
      C, Multics, and especially Unix. For a man who did not start out in the computer industry, he has had a profound influence
      on the entire computer programming world. He told Investor's Business Daily , "It's not the actual programming that's
      interesting. But it's what you can accomplish with the end results that are important." And if that is the case, then
      Ritchie has had an important effect on most, if not all, computer users today.</p>

      <h3>Ritchie's life time line:</h3>
      <div class="timeline-items">
        <p>
          <strong>1941: </strong>Born on September 9th, 1941 in Bronxville NY</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1967: </strong>Ritchie started working at Bell Labs in 1967. Here is where he worked on Multics operating system.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1968: </strong>Ritchie earned his bachelor's degree in Physics in 1963, and completed his Doctorate degree in Mathematics
          in 1968 from Harvard University.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1969: </strong>Bell Labs dropped the Multics operating systems project in 1969. This prompted Ritchie to develop
          C programming language and, with Thompson, create the UNIX operating system.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1971: </strong>Unix was released on November 3rd, 1971, opening a operating system to work on a variety of platforms
          with highly adapted quality.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1972: </strong>Ritchie and Thompson's operating system was not functioning on the more advanced PDP-11 mini computer
          in 1971. This prompted Ritchie to create C programming lanuage. C programming lanuage is very popular and important
          to the development of software including programs such as C++ and Java.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1973: </strong>Ritchie and Thompson wrote UNIX using C programming language. This allowed for UNIX to work a wide
          variety of computers in a range of large and minicomputers and advanced to simple computers.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1983: </strong>Cowinner (with Ken Thompson) of the A.M. Turing Award. It is a prestigious award and the top achievement
          in Computer Science. They recieved this award for, "their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically
          for the implementation of the UNIX operating system" (Hosch).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1988: </strong>Ritchie was elected into the U.S National Academy of Engineering in 1988.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1990: </strong>Ritchie was appointed the head of the System Software Research Department at Bell Labs in 1990.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1994: </strong>Awarded the 1994 Computer Pioneer Award, "In recognition of contribution to the development of Unix"
          (Dennis).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1995: </strong>In 1995 Ritchie (and his team) released Plan 9 operating system. Plan 9 attempted to integrate graphics
          and networking into a Unix platform. "They kept the Unix choice to mediate access to as many system services as
          possible through a single big file-hierarchy name space" (Plan 9).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1996: </strong>Ritchie (with team members) released the inferno Operating System in April 1996. Inferno is a operating
          system for building distributed and networked systems on a large range of platforms and systems. "You can fectch
          it now as Free Software, on similar terms to Linux orxBSD" (Inferno).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1999: </strong>Richie and Thompson are awarded the U.S. National Medal of Technology Award from President Bill
          Clinton for inventing UNIX and C programming language.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>2011: </strong>Died October 12th, 2011 in Berkeley Heights, NJ</p>
